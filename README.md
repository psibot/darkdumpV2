# darkdump

## About

Darkdump is an open-source OSINT tool for deep web investigation. Given a search query it fetches results from multiple dark web search engines, optionally scrapes each result site for emails, metadata, keywords, documents, and images, and streams everything live to either the terminal or a local browser-based interface. All results are automatically filtered against Ahmia's public abuse blacklist regardless of which engine is used.

## Installation

### Quick install (Linux & macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josh0xA/darkdump
cd darkdump
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
darkdump
```

This installs all dependencies and creates two commands:

| Command        | Description                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `darkdump`     | Launch the primary web interface                        |
| `darkdump-cli` | Run the CLI tool                                |

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josh0xA/darkdump
cd darkdump
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r darkdump-web/requirements.txt
```

To uninstall the launchers: `./uninstall.sh`

### Tor Configuration 
To use Darkdump effectively, you need to configure Tor to allow your script to control it via the Tor control port. Here's how to set up your `torrc` file and verify that Tor is running: <br/>

#### Step 1: Install Tor
If Tor is not already installed on your system, you need to install it. Here's how you can install Tor on various operating systems:

Debian/Kali/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tor`<br/>
MacOS: `brew install tor`<br/>

#### Step 2: Configure the Tor torrc File<br/>
Locate your torrc file. This file is usually found at `/etc/tor/torrc`on Linux and sometimes Mac. 

Add the following lines to your torrc to enable the control port and set a control port password:
```
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword [YourHashedPasswordHere]
```
Replace `[YourHashedPasswordHere]` with a hashed password which can be generated using the `tor --hash-password` command: `tor --hash-password "my_password"`

#### Step 3: Start Tor Service
Linux: `sudo systemctl start tor.service`<br/>
MacOS: `brew services start tor`<br/>

## Search Engines

Six engines are available via `-e` / `--engine`:

| Engine       | Filtered | Requires Tor | Notes                                          |
|--------------|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ahmia`      | Yes      | No           | Default. Tor Project-endorsed, strict filtering |
| `notevil`    | Partial  | Yes          | Ahmia fork with broader index                  |
| `tordex`     | **No**   | Yes          | Fully uncensored — confirmation required       |
| `tor66`      | **No**   | Yes          | Crawled index with directory — confirmation required |
| `onionland`  | **No**   | Yes          | Indexes Tor, I2P, and clearnet — confirmation required |
| `excavator`  | **No**   | Yes          | General dark web index — confirmation required |

All engines have their results checked against Ahmia's blacklist. Unfiltered engines will prompt for confirmation before executing. This strategy is still not perfect, always use extreme caution and judgement when searching and scraping unfiltered engines. 

## CLI Usage

```
darkdump-cli [-h] [-v] [-q QUERY] [-a AMOUNT] [-e ENGINE]
             [-p] [-s] [-i] [-d] [-u] [-o FILE]
             [--breach] [--breach-deep] [--breach-delay SECONDS]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-q`, `--query` | Search query |
| `-a`, `--amount` | Number of results to retrieve (default: 10) |
| `-e`, `--engine` | Engine to use (default: `ahmia`) |
| `-p`, `--proxy` | Route requests through Tor |
| `-s`, `--scrape` | Deep scrape each result for metadata, links, emails, documents |
| `-i`, `--images` | Also collect images during scrape (requires `-s`) |
| `-u`, `--unique` | Hide results with duplicate title + description |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Enable debug output |
| `-o FILE`, `--output FILE` | Save results to file — format inferred from extension (`.json`, `.csv`, `.txt`) |
| `--breach` | Run a breach / credential leak intelligence scan for the given target |
| `--breach-deep` | Combine breach scan with deep scraping of each result |
| `--breach-delay` | Seconds between breach queries to avoid rate limits (default: 1.5) |
| `-v`, `--version` | Print version |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic search via Ahmia (no Tor required)
darkdump-cli -q "privacy tools" -a 10

# Search and deep scrape each result via Tor
darkdump-cli -q "hacking" -a 10 -s -p

# Search, scrape, and collect images
darkdump-cli -q "marketplaces" -a 15 -s -p -i

# Use Not Evil engine, deduplicate, save to JSON
darkdump-cli -q "security research" -a 20 -e notevil -p -u -o results.json

# Use OnionLand engine, save to CSV
darkdump-cli -q "crypto" -a 10 -e onionland -p -o results.csv

# Breach intelligence scan for an email address
darkdump-cli --breach -q admin@example.com -e ahmia -p

# Breach scan with deep scraping
darkdump-cli --breach --breach-deep -q example.com -e ahmia
```

## Web Interface

Darkdump includes a local browser-based interface.

```bash
# If installed via install.sh
darkdump

# Or run directly
python3 darkdump-web/app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:50001` in your browser.
